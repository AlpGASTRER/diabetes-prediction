### Clinical Decision Support
- Two-stage prediction process with balanced thresholds:

     - Ensures we catch more potential diabetes cases
     - Reduces risk of false negatives in initial screening
  2. **Confirmation Stage** (threshold: 0.6)

     - Still maintains high confidence requirement for positive predictions

### Threshold Optimization
- Previous thresholds (0.3, 0.7) were found to be too conservative
- New thresholds (0.2, 0.6) provide better balance:
  - Screening: Catches more potential cases for further evaluation
  - Confirmation: Better reflects real-world diagnostic confidence levels
- Each stage includes confidence scores to support clinical decisions
- Uncertainty estimates help identify borderline cases needing additional tests

### Enhanced Confidence Score Calculation (Latest Update)

### Confidence Score Improvements
- Implemented a more sophisticated confidence score that combines model uncertainty and prediction strength
- Added risk level categorization for easier interpretation of prediction reliability

#### New Confidence Score Components
1. **Model Certainty (70% weight)**
   - Based on 1 - uncertainty score
   - Reflects the model's internal confidence in its prediction

2. **Decision Distance (30% weight)**
   - Measures how far the prediction probability is from the decision threshold (0.6)
   - Normalized to [0, 1] range
   - Higher scores for predictions further from the decision boundary

#### Risk Level Categories
Predictions are now categorized into four confidence levels:
- **Low Confidence** (0-0.3): High uncertainty or borderline predictions
- **Medium Confidence** (0.3-0.6): Moderate certainty in predictions
- **High Confidence** (0.6-0.8): Strong certainty in predictions
- **Very High Confidence** (0.8-1.0): Highest certainty, ideal for clinical decision support

This enhancement provides clinicians with:
- More nuanced understanding of prediction reliability
- Clear categorization for risk-based decision making
- Better identification of cases requiring additional clinical review
